                    <p>The story of Dark Souls II begins with a human who has become Undead, cursed to never die and
                        doomed to eventually become a Hollow, a zombie-like being with no memories or purpose. The
                        protagonist is also known as the Bearer of the Curse. To break the curse, the undead travels to
                        the fallen kingdom of Drangleic and is tasked by the Emerald Herald with obtaining four Great
                        Souls from powerful Old Ones whose names are long forgotten and forbidden. Once obtained, the
                        Emerald Herald directs the undead to "Seek the King" in the capital. After fighting through the
                        remains of the royal guards, the player encounters the Queen Nashandra, who reveals that the
                        king failed in his duty and fled his kingdom long ago. She asks the protagonist to slay the
                        king.</p>

                                        His dialogues say that he is from Mirrah. He recalls that a murderer has escaped
                                        from prison there. Cale seems to have lost his memory, but is able to recall he
                                        has met a man very similar to the murderer. Cale couldn't recall this man's
                                        name, but his stammering is enough for the player to understand he's talking
                                        about Creighton of Mirrah.
                                        After lighting all the flames on the map he will give you his armor, Cale's Set

                                        student, although she acknowledges she still has much to learn. She constantly
                                        talks highly about her teacher, a famed sorcerer from Melfia called Carhillion
                                        of the Fold. Rosabeth got fascinated by his sorceries and when Carhillion set
                                        off on a journey to Drangleic, she went after him; however, not long after that
                                        they got separated. Trying to find his whereabouts, Rosabeth was attacked by a
                                        Basilisk on her way to the Shaded Woods. She was able to close the gate that
                                        gave access to that area, but not before the Basilisk could use its petrifying
                                        breath on her, transforming her into a stone statue still holding the
                                        contraption which activated the gate.
                                        Eventually, the Bearer of the Curse released her from her petrified state. She
                                        then resumed her task of finding her teacher, although she also came to the
                                        conclusion that she might be more of a burden to him, thus deciding to keep her
                                        distance and suspecting Carhillion actually ditched her when she first lost
                                        track of him.</p>

                                        Lord, Throne Watcher and Defender, Nashandra and Elana boss fights
                                        Benhart is first found near Majula, outside of the Shaded Woods. When approached
                                        by the player, he is sitting and contemplating what to do, as the way forward is
                                        blocked by the petrified Rosabeth. When Rosabeth is unpetrified by using a
                                        Fragrant Branch of Yore, he thanks the player for clearing the way and hopes to
                                        the see them again. At this point, one can learn the "Joy" gesture from him, and
                                        it will be possible to summon him as an ally before the Prowling Magus and
                                        Congregation boss fight, in Brightstone Cove Tseldora.
                                        He can then be found next to the bonfire, past the Dragonriders, in Drangleic
                                        Castle. He remarks on the discord of the land, before changing locations. He can
                                        then be summoned to assist with the Looking Glass Knight encounter.
                                        Next, he will move to the ramparts, past The Pursuer boss fight area, in the
                                        Forest of Fallen Giants. He will state that he will assist the player in any
                                        challenge. He will then remark on the lineage of his weapon and its apparent
                                        hidden potential.
                                        If the Ashen Mist Heart is possessed, he can be found in the Memory of Orro near
                                        his position on the ramparts. He can be summoned to fight the Giant Lord. This
                                        is also the spot were he will give the player his equipment if his questline has
                                        been completed.
                                        Benhart drops the Bluemoon Greatsword upon death. If his sword is taken to
                                        Maughlin the Armorer, he will note that the sword is a fake; the true sword
                                        being the Moonlight Greatsword.

                                    <p style="width: 50%; float: left;">Drummond can be found in the Memory of Vammar.
                                        In order to gain entrance to the memory, one must talk to the Ancient Dragon
                                        back in the Dragon Shrine, who will give the player the Ashen Mist Heart. With
                                        the Heart in their possession, the player must go to the Forest of Fallen Giants
                                        and interact with the Tree of Giants located close to where Pate was found for
                                        the first time.
                                        The player will meet an exhausted Drummond early in the Memory; he is in the
                                        first large room, lying down to the right of the door. If the player talks to
                                        him, he will explain the events which led to the war against the Giants. He will
                                        also command the player to slay the Giant Lord. After exhausting his dialogue,
                                        he will be available for summoning for the fight against the Giant Lord in the
                                        Memory of Jeigh. His summon sign is located next to the fog gate.
                                        If the player speaks with Drummond, he will order his men to stand down and
                                        allow them to pass. The soldiers encountered in the memories from this point
                                        forward will not be hostile to the player and will assist them in fighting the
                                        Giants. However, if the player attacks a soldier, even accidentally, they will
                                        all turn hostile again and will remain hostile for the rest of the playthrough,
                                        even if the player speaks to Drummond again.
                                        After defeating the Giant Lord, he will give the player the Drangleic Helm,
                                        which allows the player to obtain the "Holder of the Fort" achievement/trophy.

                                    <p style="width: 50%; float: left;">When Lucatiel is found for the first time, she
                                        will introduce herself and explain her motives for being in Drangleic. She will
                                        also offer her assistance to the player during their journey.
                                        During her second encounter, Lucatiel will tell the player about her past in
                                        Mirrah. She will then take off her mask, revealing her half hollowed appearance,
                                        and give the player a Human Effigy.
                                        The third time she is met, she tells the player about her fears of losing her
                                        memories and of her brother. Lucatiel will explain how he is a better swordsman
                                        than her and she confesses that her brother, who is another victim of the curse
                                        of undeath, might be in Drangleic. She then gifts the Ring of Steel Protection
                                        +1.
                                        The fourth time that the player finds Lucatiel, she is very confused and
                                        distressed over the curse, and says she would do anything to get rid of it, even
                                        if it meant killing the player. After exhausting her dialogue, she will be
                                        available as phantom for another boss fight and will move to the next area.
                                        Lastly, Lucatiel can be found in a shack at the first bonfire of Aldia's Keep.
                                        She will be distressed if the player has not summoned and kept her alive for
                                        three boss fights, and begs the player to remember her name, as she may not.
                                        Lucatiel will disappear from the game after this encounter. If the player has
                                        summoned Lucatiel and kept her alive for three of the four summonable boss
                                        fights in the base game, she will thank the player for keeping her sane, and
                                        bequeath her armor and sword to the player. This is necessary for unlocking her
                                        achievement/trophy.

                                        swinging of his hammer at nothing except open air, and murmurs about a soft,
                                        fading ember, revealed to be the Dull Ember when the player next visits his
                                        workshop with the item in their inventory.
                                        This also may be a reference to lighting the torch in his room. By doing this
                                        he'll get up and move to his anvil, allowing access to the Craftsman's Hammer
                                        and a piece of Twinkling Titanite.
                                        The fact that you acquire the Craftsman's Hammer from the chest he is sitting on
                                        could mean he is the legendary Blacksmith mentioned in the item's description.
                                        Because of this, he could have been locked away in the cell when the Lost
                                        Bastille was originally created, as humans feared powerful people.
                                        Why McDuff is in The Lost Bastille is unclear; whether he is an undead inmate,
                                        in self-imposed exile or a remnant of the prison staff is unknown, though his
                                        situation resembles that of Rickert of Vinheim from Dark Souls.

                                        section below his above mentioned position in Earthen Peak in return for 2,000
                                        souls, leading to a Pharros' Lockstone and a piece of Twinkling Titanite. After
                                        exhausting his dialogue, he will move to Majula and sit next to the deep pit. He
                                        will offer to build three ladders, of differing lengths each, down into the pit;
                                        the longer the ladder, the more souls he will request. Please note that all the
                                        ladders do not connect to platforms and will have to be fallen off in order to
                                        reach a destination, resulting in minor fall damage.
                                        The first ladder costs 500 souls and will be very short, barely taking players
                                        down the pit.
                                        The second ladder costs 3,500 souls and will take the player approximately
                                        halfway down the pit, near the Grave of Saints.
                                        The third ladder costs 12,000 souls and will take the player close to the bottom
                                        of the pit, near The Gutter.
                                        He will give the player his unique Melu Scimitar as a gift for purchasing the
                                        longest and most expensive ladder, which will also unlock the Garrulous Miser
                                        Trophy and Achievement.

                                                The Smelter Demon is similar to the Iron Golem in Dark Souls in that the
                                                Demon is a construct made of iron that has been animated through some
                                                means. His body is made entirely of iron except for a portion of his
                                                chest, which is hollow and exposes a core of flames.
                                                The Smelter Demon was responsible for the death of the Iron King, and
                                                the fall of his kingdom.</p>

                                                inside the Shrine of Amana due to it developing a taste for human flesh.

                                                became hollow, the demon was able to escape its prison. Its name comes
                                                from its ability to mimic the song of the Milfanito, in order to lure

                                                Aldia is the elder brother of King Vendrick, and aided his brother in
                                                founding the kingdom of Drangleic. He secluded himself in his manor,
                                                searching for secrets of life, viewing the Undead as the key to finding

                                                Vendrick, banished to his Keep forever. People who were invited to

                                                reason. For his service the Iron King bestowed Alonne's name to his

                                                The Smelter Demon is similar to the Iron Golem in Dark Souls in that it
                                                is a construct made of iron that is given life through some means. Its
                                                body is made entirely of iron except for a portion of its chest, which
                                                is hollow and exposes a core of magical flame. It is mostly the same as
                                                the Smelter Demon from the Iron Keep, with some visual differences.</p>

                                                The Ivory King was once the ruler of Eleum Loyce. His origins are said
                                                to trace back to the kingdom of Forossa, where he served as a high
                                                ranking knight. The Ivory King was described as a compassionate and
                                                strong ruler, always the first to swing his sword in times of need for
                                                the good of his people or for his homeland. When a lost child of Dark
                                                named Alsanna sought to sustain herself using the powerful king, he
                                                granted her protection and comfort despite possibly knowing her true
                                                intentions.</p>

                    Classes in Dark Souls determine the starting Stats and Equipment of the player. There are 10 Classes
                    in Dark Souls that the player can begin the game with. They are listed below:

                    Classes do not determine what weapons, items, armor, or spells your character is able to use, they
                    only determine what your character starts the game with. As you progress through the game and raise
                    your levels, your character can potentially take up any role regardless of class.

                    In addition to choosing a class, players can choose a gift to begin the game with. All gifts can be
                    found in the game later on, but taking one here can let the player enjoy a benefit they wouldn't
                    normally have until much later. A first time player should be careful about choosing gifts that will
                    let them enter end-game areas from the start of the game such as the Master Key, since they could
                    potentially end up stranded in a very difficult area without the knowledge or equipment to get back
                    out. Note that the Master Key is infinitely reusable, and the Thief starting class begins the game
                    with one already. Taking a second Master Key as a Thief is a waste of a gift.

                    The cost of raising a level increases as your character's level increases. The amount of souls each
                    level costs is the same for all classes, though classes begin at different levels. For example, a
                    character that starts at level 1 may find leveling up to be extremely affordable, but the character
                    who starts at level 10 didn't have to pay anything to get to that point. When the level 1 character
                    reaches level 10, going from 10 to level 11 will cost exactly the same amount of souls as it would
                    for the character who started at level 10. Because of this, starting at a lower level actually ends
                    up costing more overall, however the player will be able to put their stats exactly where they want
                    them instead of starting with a more pre-determined kit. The starting level of a character ignores
                    the Resistance stat, so characters with high resistance start at lower levels than they would
                    normally have otherwise.
